# takaku

takaku is a implementation of the pencil-and-paper abstract strategy game [Sim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim_(game)) written in C++ using raylib.

It features:
- Support for arbitrarily large board sizes.
- Versus human and versus AI (one difficulty) game modes.
- An interactive board (graph) with vertices that can be moved around the screen.

You can build the project using the provided Makefile, though you will need to install raylib.
